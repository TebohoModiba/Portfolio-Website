- **Filterable Projects Grid** with live state filtering (React `useState`)
- **Clickable Project Cards** that open GitHub repositories
- **Functional Contact Form** with validation, WhatsApp deep linking, and fallback email
- **Floating Action Button** for quick GitHub access
- **Fully Responsive** design with mobile-first approach and multiple breakpoints

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology       | Purpose                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **React 18**     | UI components & state management (via CDN) |
| **JSX + Babel**  | Transpilation for modern React syntax |
| **CSS3**         | Custom properties, Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Dark mode |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Logic, form handling, localStorage |
| **HTML5**        | Semantic structure                   |

**Notable Implementation Details:**
- No build tools (Vite/Create-React-App) — pure client-side React via CDN for simplicity and fast loading
- Custom routing system without React Router
- Pure CSS animations (no Framer Motion or external libraries)
- Mobile hamburger menu with smooth state transitions
